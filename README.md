# Visual® Studio™ Code™ Memes®❗️

Programmers are extraordinary people, people who care a lot about creating and maintaining software, innovating with each line of code, hacking whatever they can to suit our needs. They are 24/7 focused on writing code, fixing bugs while creating more bugs, fixing warnings and creating errors, then fixing them and turning them into warnings again,... and they often miss the most important part of life, which is `fun` (not as in function).

Visual® Studio™ Code™️ Memes® brings amusing memes to the code editor, the place where innovation is born. That place is now merged with good entertainment for our keyboard heroes, programmers will now be shown random programming memes each five minutes, to relax and forget about their bugs and errors while they read a good meme.

### How to use?

Visual® Studio™ Code™️ Memes® is not loaded automatically on startup yet, because I was too lazy to figure out how to do it, and maybe that will never change, so for now all you have to do is to open the command palette and execute the command called: `Memes: Start VS-memes session`, then you have to wait five minutes and a random meme will bring joy to your life. Each five minutes, another meme will appear, and so on, until you stop the session.

### How to stop?

That's pretty simple, actually, all you have to do is execute the `Memes: Stop VS-memes session` command in your command palette and no more memes will appear.

### How to change interval?

	No.

### Isn't this too distracting?

	Well no, but actually yes.

## Credits

All memes are scrapped from the subreddit [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor) on [Reddit](https://reddit.com) using the amazing [Meme API](https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api) licensed under the MIT licence, and therefore, all the credit goes to r/ProgrammerHumor, Reddit and Meme API. Also, to some small JS libraries I'm using, you can check them in the `package.json` because I'm too lazy to write them here. I was too lazy to implement a client-side Reddit image scraper, so I used that Meme API, please don't overload it, it's not mine.

## Licence

Yeah, the classic GNU General Public Licence v3. Why would you want to use this extension on a proprietary project? This is more than okay and thanks to Richard Stallman.

## One more thing...™

This code is completely horrible (since it was my first VS Code extension), this project might never get famous and it's likely that you are not interested on contributing at all. If it was the opposite case (which I really doubt), please help me to improve this shit and add more features.
